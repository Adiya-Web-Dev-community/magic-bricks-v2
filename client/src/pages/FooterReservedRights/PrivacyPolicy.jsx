        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p>
            There are a number of laws which set out important standards
            regarding information that identifies a living individual. This is
            known as “personal data.” All organisations processing personal data
            must do so fairly and lawfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            We treat our obligations seriously and take all steps necessary to
            comply when we store and process your personal data.
          </p>

            It is essential to us to collect, store and process only the minimum
            required amount of personal data so that we can offer and perform
            our services. Typical information we might ask for includes your
            name, your address, other contact details and Anti Money Laundering

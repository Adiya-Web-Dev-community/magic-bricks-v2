            Investments offered by DuoFraction are intended to be held until the
            end of the Investment Period of 5 Years and are not listed. We
            provide a Secondary Transfer Facility (referred to as “Exit Window”)
            on the platform where you can sell your investment before the end of
            the recommended term. A Secondary Transfer Facility on DuoFraction
            is only available for 2 weeks at a time, twice a year. Therefore,
            you may not be able to exit early from your investment, and as such
            it is likely to be an illiquid investment. Please do not make an
            investment with DuoFraction if your intention is not to hold the
            investment for the recommended term. Even with a Secondary Transfer
            Facility available on DuoFraction, there is still no guarantee that
            you will be able to sell your investment.”

            Investment in real estate is speculative. Investors through
            DuoFraction will not directly own the property, rather they will
            have a share in a private special purpose vehicle owning the
            property. The value of your investments may experience losses and
            anticipated returns may not materialize as forecasted. In addition,
            you may experience delays in being paid from rental income or it may
            be difficult to sell the property at the end ofthe investment
            period. In some cases, there may be government restrictions on the
            sale of a property to foreign owners, which may restrict the range
            of potential buyers. DuoFraction offers investments that are
            materially different than direct, outright ownership of property,
            investments in real estate funds, REITs or other securities or
            interests. If DuoFraction ceases to carry on its business, you may
            experience losses, incur costs and/or delays in being paid. Using
            credit or borrowed monies to invest on DuoFraction carries a greater
            risk as even if your investment declines in value, you will still
            need to meet your repayment obligations.
